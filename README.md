●     Inside the Scaffold, create an AppBar with the title "My Shopping List".
●     Below the AppBar, create a ListView widget to display the list of shopping items.
●     Each item in the list should be represented by a ListTile widget.
●     Each ListTile should display an icon on the left, followed by the name of the shopping item.
●     The list should have at least 5 shopping items.
